# SP2020-BAAK
## Key Idea
- Visualization to capture the distance of a project dependencies to all available vulnerabilities.
- Maybe our assumption is that if a vulnerability library is co-used, there is a closer distance.
- Adjusted idea is that we can make a report on those that are affected by a vulnerability. We would like to characterize the projects based on similarities. Proposed measures could be textual descriptions, source code and the dependencies similarities.
